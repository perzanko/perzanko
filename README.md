### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer with several years of professional experience in building highly available and reliable web solutions.

In work in a team, I try to use DDD techniques to describe the business domain and design IT solutions. As for the code in itself, I pay a lot of attention to its quality. I'm trying to use the knowledge gained while studying books written by people who are old hands at software engineering.

When it comes to my interests and plans for the future, I develop my skills towards broadly understood system architecture and after hours I delve into the secrets of engineering building distributed, concurrent applications using the greatness of Elixir language and OTP.

- Some buzzwords to boost search results: DDD, Event Storming, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Clean Architecture, TDD, BDD.
- Languages I play with: Node.js/Typescript, Elixir, Rust, Python, Ruby, Elm, PHP (order matters)
- What I use: AWS, Serverless, PostgresSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, Grafana, CircleCI, React, Angular, Nest.js, Express.js, Phoenix/OTP, Heroku, Aptible
